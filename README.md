# Fundamentals of Data Analysis

Repository for the project for the Fundamentals of Data Analysis module @ GMIT - 2020

Author: Maciej Izydorek Email: G00387873@gmit.ie Github: [mizydorek](https://github.com/mizydorek)

#### Project Overview

Perform and explain simple linear regression using Python on the powerproduction dataset. The goal is to accurately predict wind turbine power output from wind speed values using the data set as a basis. Train a model based on the power production data that includes the wind speed and the power output by fitting simple linear regression to accurately predict a power output of wind turbine. By training a model that it can give an estimate on how much can generate power output based on the wind speed value.

#### Contents of repository

The repository contains:

* `README.md` file
* `project.ipynb` — jupyter notebook contains solution to the project
* `requirements.txt` — contains list of packages need to run the notebook
* `.gitignore` — contains list of files that have to be ignore
* `assessment.pdf` — contains project overview and requirements
* `powerproduction.csv` — Power production dataset

#### Required software

The following software is required to run the notebook:

* `git` — open source software to download the repository onto computer[3]
* `python` — Python Programming Language
* `Numpy. Matplotlib. Seaborn. Jupyter. Pandas. SciPy. Sklearn` — python packages used to make an investigation into the numpy.random package[5,6,7,8,9,10] 

The following command will install the packages according to the configuration file

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

or alternatively 

* `Anaconda` — Individual edition of Anaconda can be install to get all of the relevant software.[4]

#### Instructions for downloading repository

At github repository [Fundamentals of Data Analysis](https://github.com/mizydorek/Fundamentals-of-Data-Analysis-Project-2020) click on the green `Code` button to copy the link. Open command line(windows) or terminal(osx/linux), navigate to the selected directory and enter the command `git clone` folowed copied the URL. Alternatively copy the whole command below:

```
git clone https://github.com/mizydorek/Fundamentals-of-Data-Analysis-Project-2020.git
```

The whole repository will be cloned down onto current working directory.

#### How to run the jupyter notebook

From there run `jupyter notebook` command on the command line/terminal. This will open Jupyter in the browser. The notebook containing solution that is called `project.ipynb` can be opened by clicking on it.
Once opened, select `Restart and Run All` from Kernel sub-menu to run the jupyter notebook.

#### Viewing the Notebook 

The notebook can be viewed online either on the [github](https://github.com/mizydorek/Fundamentals-of-Data-Analysis-Project-2020/blob/main/project.ipynb) or by accessing through Jupyter Notebooks viewer  [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mizydorek/Fundamentals-of-Data-Analysis-Project-2020/blob/main/project.ipynb).
